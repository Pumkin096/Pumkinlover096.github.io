<h1> Welcome </h1>
  <h2>Are you tired of getting offline raided every time? Do you play on a modded servers? Well if you anwsered yes then you are in luck.</h2>
  <h3> I will teach you how to not get raided for the whole wipe :O </h3>
<p> â€Ž  </p>
<h1> So you came here to learn my most awesome base ever and im very happy about it.</h1>
 <h3>First of, you should make a 2x2 with honeycone walls outside</h3>
  <h2> example here </h2> <img src= 2x2 base image>
  <h3>Next you should check that your sever has a remove tool! And after that remove the wall oposed of your TC and it should look like this.</h3>

  <h3> Remove your TC and place it inside the honeycone and remember to place some boxes inside and a bag if you have room for it. </h3>

  <h3> Remember to close the wall after locking off so you will have your started base loot safe!</h3>
  <h3>This is going to be your started base for now and it can be upgrated more</h3>
  <h1>Step two</h1>
  <h3>Upgrade your base to be 3 stories tall and dont add anything to the third floor because you are going to be living in there ;)</h3>
  <h3> Then just make your base look like it has been raided or just leave it like that and start building the third floor</h3>
  <h3>Ill add a video here to get a better idea on what i am saying</h3>

  <h3>If you did everything right, you should not get raided for a LOOOOONG time. Just note that cheaters will be able to see true walls and they might find your loot room, so be careful and pray you dont get cheated on!</h3>
